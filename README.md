Project for my first bachelor year. This code runs two different MIDI controllers, one for a guitar hero drum set and one for a low level portable keyboard. The drum set uses piezos and is therefore velocity-sensitive, while the kyboard uses a shift register.

The code is dirty and ugly (I was young!)
